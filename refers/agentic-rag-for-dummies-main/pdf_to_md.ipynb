        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "Converting PDF documents to Markdown is often the **most critical step** in building an effective RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system. Markdown strikes an optimal balance: it preserves the structural hierarchy of the original document (headers, lists, tables, code, formulas) while remaining lightweight and directly consumable by LLMs without additional preprocessing.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why Markdown over plain text or JSON?**\n",
        "\n",
        "While plain text extraction is fast and JSON provides structured data, **Markdown is superior for RAG systems** because it:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Preserves document structure**: Headers, subheaders, lists, and formatting hierarchy remain intact, helping LLMs understand the logical flow and relationships between sections\n",
        "- **Maintains semantic meaning**: Bold, italic, code blocks, and other formatting cues provide context that aids comprehension\n",
        "- **Handles complex elements naturally**: Tables, code blocks, mathematical formulas, and blockquotes are represented in a standardized, readable format\n",
        "- **Human and machine readable**: Unlike JSON's rigid key-value structure or plain text's lack of hierarchy, Markdown balances readability for both humans and LLMs\n",
        "- **Optimal for chunking**: Clear structural boundaries (headers, paragraphs) make intelligent document chunking straightforward for retrieval\n",
        "\n",
        "Plain text loses all formatting and structure, making it difficult for retrieval systems to distinguish between titles, body text, and metadata. JSON can capture structure but often requires custom schemas and is verbose for text-heavy documents. Markdown naturally bridges this gap.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why is this conversion so important?**\n",
        "\n",
        "The quality of your RAG system is fundamentally constrained by the quality of your extracted data. Poorly extracted or \"dirty\" data—text with broken formatting, missing tables, garbled formulas, or lost context—leads directly to inaccurate retrieval and hallucinated responses. Before implementing any extraction pipeline, you must ask yourself:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **What type of content do my PDFs contain?** Plain text only? Images? Tables? Mathematical formulas?\n",
        "- **How complex is the layout?** Single-column? Multi-column? Mixed layouts with sidebars?\n",
        "- **Are there visual elements?** Diagrams, charts, photographs that carry semantic meaning?\n",
        "- **Are the documents scanned?** Scanned PDFs require OCR capabilities regardless of layout complexity.\n",

        "- Each PDF page is rendered as a high-resolution image (typically 300 DPI)\n",
        "- The image is sent to the VLM along with a detailed system prompt\n",
        "- The model analyzes the visual content and outputs structured Markdown\n",
        "- Pages are processed sequentially and combined into a single document\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Best for:** Scientific papers, infographics, medical reports, technical diagrams\n",
